# Data Deletion Instructions

You can permanently delete your account and all associated data at any time. We offer two methods to do this:

### 1. In-App Deletion (Recommended)

The easiest and fastest way to delete your data is directly within our apps (**Music Logger** & **Music Hunter**).

1.  Open the app and navigate to the **Settings** screen.
2.  Select the **Account** section.
3.  Tap on the **"Delete Account"** button.
4.  Confirm the deletion. Your account and all cloud data (recognition history, user profile) will be permanently erased.

### 2. Deletion via Email Request

If you are unable to access the app, you can request deletion by sending an email to our support address:

*   **To:** `music.logger.app@gmail.com`
*   **Subject:** `Data Deletion Request`

Please send the email from the address associated with your account to help us verify your identity.
