## 2. Audio Recognition & Microphone
To provide music recognition features, "Music Logger" requires access to your device's microphone (`android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO`). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency regarding how this data is handled.

**Key Information on Data Processing:**

* **No Permanent Storage:** No audio recordings are permanently stored on your device.
* **No Audio Transmission:** No raw audio files are ever transmitted to our servers or any third parties.
* **Local Processing:** The audio stream is processed directly on your device to generate a unique digital fingerprint.
* **Third-Party Services (ACRCloud & Shazam):** Only this anonymous digital fingerprint (which cannot be converted back into audio) is sent to our recognition providers, such as ACRCloud or Apple (Shazam), solely for the purpose of retrieving song metadata (Title, Artist).

We do not listen to, record, or store your conversations or environment audio for any other purpose.

## 3. Data Processing via Recognition Providers
To identify songs, we use external services provided by **ACRCloud** and **Apple (Shazam)**.

* **Purpose:** Music Recognition.
* **Data Transmitted:** Digital Fingerprints (No raw audio).
* **Legal Basis:** Your Consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR), which you grant by allowing microphone access in the app.

## 4. Your Rights
Under the GDPR, you have the following rights regarding your data:

* **Right to Access & Correction:** You can ask for details about the data we hold.
* **Right to Deletion:** You can request the deletion of your data.
* **Right to Withdraw Consent:** You can revoke the microphone permission at any time in your device settings. This stops all data processing immediately.
* **Right to Complain:** You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe your privacy rights have been violated.
