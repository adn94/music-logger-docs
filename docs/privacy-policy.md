## Microphone Access & Audio Data Handling

To provide music recognition features, "Music Logger" requires access to your device's microphone (`android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO`). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency regarding how this data is handled.

**Key Information on Data Processing:**

1.  **No Permanent Storage:** No audio recordings are permanently stored on your device.
2.  **No Audio Transmission:** No raw audio files are ever transmitted to our servers or any third parties.
3.  **Local Processing:** The audio stream is processed directly on your device to generate a unique digital fingerprint.
4.  **Third-Party Service (ACRCloud):** Only this anonymous digital fingerprint (which cannot be converted back into audio) is sent to our recognition provider, ACRCloud, solely for the purpose of retrieving song metadata (Title, Artist).

We do not listen to, record, or store your conversations or environment audio for any other purpose.
